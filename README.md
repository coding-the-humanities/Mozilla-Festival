Humanizing Code
===============

## What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?

The world of programming education is currently exploding. 
This talk will both survey the current approaches as well 
as take a deep dive into the approach-agnostic theoretical 
and pedagogical challenges of teaching programming and computer 
science, mainly: abstraction. 

Examples from multiple disciplines will identify the problem of 
teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, 
and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities 
with issues in computer science. 

In programming education, abstraction has long been mistaken as the prerogative 
of mathematicians. Abstraction, however, is a feature of every linguistic system. 
The fact that humanities' students, are trained in mastering languages often makes 
them excellent programmers. This fact by now has been acknowled by the software industry, 
but is almost completely ignored by the education system. Here coding is still 
located in the STEM departments and taught as a computational skill.

The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer
science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more 
effective and creative solutions to both teaching abstractions and 
developing abstractions. As well as exploring the tools and methods needed 
to progress these innovations.

## How do you see that working?

- _Introduction to Coding for the Humanities program_ (Jan Hein)

- _Introduction to Digital Wesleyan and Flatiron School programs_ (Ashley)

- _Towards a more technical humanities student_ (Jan Hein)
  
  This section will explore the unique characteristics of a humanities student, their specific strengths and weaknesses. 

- _Towards a more interdisciplinary engineer_ (Ashley)

  This section will explore how thought-leaders from the humanities and sciences can and should influence engineering tools, workflows, and communities.
  
  
- _Where we are now_ (Ashley)

  This section will survey a sample of current approaches to teaching programming and will critically engage with their effectiveness for certain types of communities.

- _Where we want to go_ (Jan Hein)

  This section will propose ways to further the development of interdisciplinary engineering communities. It will focus on the ramifications that the emergence of these new types students / engineers have on education. Central to
  this approach is the idea that coding blurs the line between learning and research. We propose that education (technical as well as non-technical) capitalizes on this potential. However, in order to do so, we need more and better tools, libraries, and methods to facilitate these researchers.

## How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?

*5 participants* - a short presentation followed by a group discussion 

*15 participants* - a short presentation followed by a group discussion

*50 participants* - a longer presentation followed by a Q&A session

## What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward? 

Ideally, participants in this session will be imbued with a greater understanding of how the humanities can influence developer and engineering communites. This understanding should inspire and encourage them to diversify their communities and pursuits, as well as evangelize such diversification. Specific examples could be getting involved with local universities' humanities programs, starting interdisciplinary conferences, journals and meetups, and building open source curriculum targeted at people with humanities backgrounds.

The Coding the Humanities platform is offering support in setting up such activities and will provide a repository for these open source curricula and custom tools.
