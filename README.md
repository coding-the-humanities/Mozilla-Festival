Humanizing Code
===============

## What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?

The world of programming education is currently exploding. 
This talk will both survey the current approaches as well 
as take a deep dive into the approach-agnostic theoretical 
and pedagogical challenge of teaching programming and computer 
science, mainly: abstraction. Examples from multiple disciplines 
will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous 
demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science. The talk will conclude with a discussion of how 
the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can
inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both teaching abstractions and developing abstractions. 

## How do you see that working?


## How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?

## What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward? 

Ideally, participants in this session will be imbued with a greater understanding of how the humanities can influence developer and engineering communites. This understanding should inspire and encourage them to diversify their communities and pursuits, as well as evangelize such diversification. Specific examples could be getting involved with local universities' humanities programs, starting interdisciplinary conferences and meetups, and building open source curriculum targeted at people with humanities backgrounds.
