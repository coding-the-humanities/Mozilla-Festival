Humanizing Code
===============

The world of programming education is currently exploding. 
This talk will both survey the current approaches as well 
as take a deep dive into the approach-agnostic theoretical 
and pedagogical challenge of teaching programming and computer 
science, mainly: abstraction. Examples from multiple disciplines 
will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous 
demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity 
and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer 
science. The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline 
of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other 
to produce more effective and creative solutions to both teaching 
abstractions and developing abstractions.
