Humanizing Code
===============

## What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?

The world of programming education is currently exploding. 
This talk will both survey the current approaches as well 
as take a deep dive into the approach-agnostic theoretical 
and pedagogical challenges of teaching programming and computer 
science, mainly: abstraction. 

Examples from multiple disciplines will identify the problem of 
teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, 
and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities 
with issues in computer science. 

In programming education, abstraction has long been mistaken as the prerogative 
of mathematicians. Abstraction, however, is a feature of every linguistic system. 
The fact that humanities' students, are trained in mastering languages often makes 
them excellent programmers. This fact by now has been acknowled by the software industry, 
but is almost completely ignored by the education system. Here coding is still 
located in the STEM departments and taught as a computational skill.

The talk will conclude with a workshop where participants will
collaborate on curriculum modules focused specifically on facilitaitign
the computational answering humanities questions, as well as teaching
students with a humanities background.

## How do you see that working?

### Presentation

+ Introduction to Coding for the Humanities program (Jan Hein)

+ Introduction to Digital Wesleyan and Flatiron School programs (Ashley)

+ Towards a more technical humanities student (Jan Hein)
  
  + This section will explore the unique characteristics of a humanities
    student, their specific strengths and weaknesses.

+ Towards a more interdisciplinary engineer (Ashley)

  +  This section will explore how thought-leaders from the humanities and
     sciences can and should influence engineering tools, workflows, and
     communities.
  
  
+ Where we are now (Ashley)

  + This section will survey a sample of current approaches to teaching
    programming and will critically engage with their effectiveness for
    certain types of communities.

+ Where we want to go (Jan Hein)

  + This section will propose ways to further the development of
    interdisciplinary engineering communities. It will focus on the
    ramifications that the emergence of these new types students / engineers
    have on education. Central to this approach is the idea that coding
    blurs the line between learning and research. We propose that education
    (technical as well as non-technical) capitalizes on this potential.
    However, in order to do so, we need more and better tools, libraries,
    and methods to facilitate these researchers.

###Curriculum Building Workshop

## How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?

*5 participants* - a short presentation followed by a group discussion and workshop 

*15 participants* - a short presentation followed by a group discussion and workshop

*50 participants* - a longer presentation followed by a Q&A session and workshop

## What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your  participants take the learning and activities forward?

Ideally, participants in this session will be imbued with a greater
understanding of how the humanities can influence developer and
engineering communites. This understanding should inspire and encourage
them to diversify their communities and pursuits, as well as evangelize
such diversification. Specific examples could be getting involved with
local universities' humanities programs, starting interdisciplinary
conferences, journals and meetups, and building open source curriculum
targeted at people with humanities backgrounds.

The Coding the Humanities platform is offering support in setting up
such activities and will provide a repository for these open source
curricula and custom tools. The workshop portion of this session will
see the continued development of these tools.
